# Laravel Address Book

##Objective

Build a basic address book CRUD application using laravel

## Official Documentation for Laravel

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).

## Methodology

* Installed Composer and Laravel
* Set-up up a server on localhost:8888 with PHP
* Installed Virtual Box and Vagrant
* Installed Homestead
* Created a new controller, which allowed the user to view a home page for the address book


## Issues

I encountered several dependancy issues in my inital set-up, which prohibited view to the controller I created.
After killing a couple of repos to try to start fresh, I spent a great deal of time researching the issues. I discovered
Illuminate html was no longer a valid option for Laravel 5 and updated LaravelCollective through composer.
In hindsight, it would have been more productive to not re-visit the laracasts and move straight to the documentation sooner.
